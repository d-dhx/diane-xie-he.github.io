- 15-362 Computer Graphics ðŸ’¡

  My favorite 15-XXX class so far! Materials cover the fundamental graphics pipeline. The programming assignment (there are 4 phases throughout the semester) is to build a 3D modelling software called Scotty 3D. Sometimes debugging can be really tedious, since the provided testcases are easy to pass but GUI is still broken. The writeup at some points is a bit unclear and outdated.

- 21-325 Probability

  Took this to fullfill graduation requirement. I am not a math person since elementary school, but it turned out to be not that bad. It's indeed very proof-heavy, but the workload is reasonable for a 9 units course. Nearly half of the materials were covered by other cs classes I've taken in previous semesters (Expectations, Markov's inequality, etc.).

With this you can generate visualizations like:

{% tabs log %}

{% tab log php %}

```php
var_dump('hello');
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab log js %}

```javascript
console.log("hello");
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab log ruby %}

```javascript
pputs 'hello'
```

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

## Another example

{% tabs data-struct %}

{% tab data-struct yaml %}

```yaml
hello:
  - "whatsup"
  - "hi"
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab data-struct json %}

```json
{
  "hello": ["whatsup", "hi"]
}
```

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

## Tabs for something else

{% tabs something-else %}

{% tab something-else text %}

Regular text

{% endtab %}

{% tab something-else quote %}

> A quote

{% endtab %}

{% tab something-else list %}

Hipster list

- brunch
- fixie
- raybans
- messenger bag

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}
